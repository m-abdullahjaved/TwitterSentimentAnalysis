# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing Project

Twitter Sentiment Analysis project employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
techniques and machine learning models to classify airline-related tweets into positive, negative, 
or neutral sentiments. The project encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization, 
and machine learning strategies, including TF-IDF vectorization and handling class imbalance 
using SMOTE. Various classifiers are trained, and their performances are evaluated, emphasizing 
the significance of addressing imbalanced data. The outcomes contribute to a systematic approach 
for sentiment analysis, particularly in the context of the airline industry, with potential applications 
across diverse domains. We have achieved accuracy of 98%.
